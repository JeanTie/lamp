# Learning Artificial Machine Pedagogy

## Overview

This project is a small, C-based framework for exploring and learning about artifical neural networks and machine learning. It is designed as a personal learning exercise, not intended for prdouction or any serious use. Expect bugs and potentially incorret results!

## Goals

* To build a basic understanding of neural network concepts trough hands-on coding.
* To experiment with different network architectures, activation functions and training methods.
* To improve my programming skills.
* To do something out of my comfort zone.

## Current State

This is just the beginning! The framework is in its early stages of development. There are no concrete plans beyond implementing fundamental building blocks.\
Expect everything to change!

## Features (Planned)
* Basic feed forward neural network

## Getting started

(Instruction on how to build and run the project, once ther is some code.)
